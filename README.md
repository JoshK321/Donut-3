	HTML is mainly used to develop and create web pages and applications. It also structures web pages with tags and elements. It can define the headings, paragraphs and other contents of the web page. CSS is used to alter the appearance and the style of the page. Examples are font, color, size, and spacing of the content, or to add animations and other decorative features. It is used a lot to style social media platforms. HTML and CSS are essential for the appearance of websites. 
CSS and HTML are still widely used today, especially in web development. HTML is the language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and such. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage (as Mr.Prins said.)
CSS is used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements. It allows developers to change the appearance of elements, such as their colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS acts like the skin and makeup of a webpage, making it look attractive and appealing to users.
Together, HTML and CSS work hand in hand to create visually appealing and well-structured web pages. HTML defines the content, while CSS enhances its appearance and layout. This combination is essential for creating websites, from simple blogs to complex platforms.
	While we use electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers to access the internet, responsive web design has become crucial. HTML and CSS are used to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions, providing an optimal viewing experience for users on all devices.
	Separating the HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain and update a website. Changes to the design can be made in the CSS without altering the HTML structure, improving code organization and readability.
	Search engines rely heavily on HTML markup to understand and index web pages. Semantic HTML helps search engines accurately interpret the content of a page, which can positively impact its search ranking.
In summary, HTML and CSS are crucial for building well-structured, good looking, and accessible web pages. They form the foundation of web development and are essential skills for anyone working in the field of web design and development.
